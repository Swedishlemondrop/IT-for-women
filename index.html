            <h2>Top Three Candles For Spring</h2>
            <p> 
                 Spring is here and nothing says spring quite like florals.
            Not only are they fragrant but they’re visually stimulating too. 
            They offer variety and do an amazing job of uplifting your mood. 
            What’s the next best thing to a fresh bouquet? Floral-scented 
            candles! To kickoff the season I’ve compiled my list of this year’s
             5 must-have floral-scented candles.
             <section>
            <h1>1. Lys Magicus by Amanda de Montal</h1>    
           Lys Magicus embodies floral – I love it! The throw is strong but 
           not overpowering. It fills not only the room but the entire home, 
           plus the fragrance lasts! If you’re a floral enthusiast this 
           floral-scented candle is a must-have. Amanda de Montal really did
            a great job with this one – they offer an amazing collection with 
            so much variety – from fruity to sexy, every category is perfectly 
            executed.

                <li>Burn Time: 30-40 hours</li>
                <li>Wax Type: Bees wax</li>
                <li>Throw: Light</li>
            
            </ul>
            <h1>2. Harlem Candle Company</h1>
        </p>This candle has beautiful notes of gardenia, sparkling bergamot, 
        coffee flower, and a creamy sweetness thanks to the addictive base 
        of coconut milk. The throw is perfect – not too heavy but fills the 
        room. It’s gardenia done beautifully. Every one of the Harlem Candle 
        Company’s candles tells a story and this one is no different. 
        Lady Day is about Billie Holiday – irresistible excitement and her 
        joie de vivre. You’ll definitely be seduced by this one.

        <h1><a href="https://carrierefreres.com/us_en/candles-home-fragrances/scented-candles/iris.html" target="_blank">3. Iris by Carriere Freres</a></h1>
        <p>I discovered this candle last summer and you know what? I love it 
            just as much now as I did then. All of Carriere Freres candles are 
            single-note based – they keep it simple so that each fragrance is 
            at its purest. Iris is an absolute delight – it’s a perfect blend 
            of sweet and floral. If you’re a newbie when it comes to 
            floral-scented candles, this enveloping yet comforting fragrance 
            is a great intro</p>
